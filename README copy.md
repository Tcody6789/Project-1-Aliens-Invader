# ARTD475 Programming : Project01
 
## Interactive Game

**Prototype: Due: Wednesday, 03/27/2024, 8:00am** (We will discuss in class)

**Final: Due: Monday, 04/08/2024, 8:00am** (Students will present during  class)

**_Description:_**

- Create a simple interactive game which enables the player(s) to control aspects of the game using the mouse and/or keyboard.
- You may want to leverage the character youâ€™ve created in the first few assignments to be a character in your game, but that is not required.
- Leverage object oriented programming to organize the components of your game. For example, create a class for different types of characters, or objects.  Behaviors could be functions of the class. 
- Arrays/lists could be used to store/organize multiple instances of characters/objects.
- Take time to consider the logic of how the components fit together.  
- Start simple, and build things up incrementally.

**_Prototype:_**

- Incremental Development
  - **Develop an idea**
  - **Break that idea into smaller manageable parts**
  - **Work out an algorithm for each part**
  - **Write the code for each part**
  - Working out the algorithm for all the parts together
  - Integrating the code for all of the parts together
- **Document code**

For the prototype you should have these first 4 items done, or at least mostly done, and written out.   It would be ideal to have at least some, if not all, of the individual parts implemented as separate sketches.  
In the **index.html** file in the Prototype directory of your repository include text which describes what each of the parts are, and indicates which parts implement each of the individual components.


**_Final:_**

- Must leverage classes/objects
- Must include user interaction (mouse and/or keyboard)
- Keep and display score
- Can be single or multiple player
- Game description
 - Object of the game
 - How to score
  - How to use controls
- **Document code**

In the **index.html** file in the Final directory of your repository indclude text that describes your game and how to play it.
